Best way to learn any programming language is to make some good conceptual projects for the better understanding of the language.This folder is completely dedeicated to the projects which I have done while learning Python.

tic-tac-toe.py Is our childhood tic-tac-toe game which I have done just to understand the complete flow of the codes in python(basically functions).

sudoku.py Is another project in python using the backtracking method just to understand that how this algorithm works in python.

Fake_news is an advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.

Many more projects is to be added......
